# Mini Project Zettacamp#3 - Restaurant (Backend)

This project was created during an intensive bootcamp from Zettabyte Pte. Ltd. over 3 months as the final project and proof of learning from those 3 months.

I created a GraphQL server to handle client requests to the server. The chosen theme is a restaurant, which must meet several criteria such as management systems, balance systems, authentication and authorization, and dynamic data.

This project has been moved from [zettacamp github](https://github.com/zettacamp-bagas-arisandi/bagas_zettacamp_catfish) because it was required to use a dedicated bootcamp GitHub account at that time, so this is just a copy without any modifications.
